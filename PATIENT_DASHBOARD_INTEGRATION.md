# üè• Patient Dashboard - Real Data Integration

## ‚úÖ Completed!

The patient dashboard now fetches **real data** from the PostgreSQL database instead of using hardcoded mock data.

---

## üîß What Was Built

### 1. API Endpoint: `/api/patient/dashboard`
**File:** `app/api/patient/dashboard/route.ts`

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Authenticates user via middleware headers
- ‚úÖ Fetches patient profile with user details
- ‚úÖ Gets upcoming appointments with doctor info
- ‚úÖ Retrieves active prescriptions with medication names
- ‚úÖ Loads recent medical records with doctor details

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "profile": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "user_id": "uuid",
      "medical_record_number": "MRN-12345",
      "blood_type": "O+",
      "height_cm": 175,
      "weight_kg": 70,
      "allergies": ["Penicillin"],
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "phone": "+1234567890",
      "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",
      "gender": "male"
    },
    "upcomingAppointments": [...],
    "activePrescriptions": [...],
    "recentRecords": [...]
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated Patient Dashboard
**File:** `app/patient/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ‚ùå Removed hardcoded `PATIENT_DATA`
- ‚úÖ Added `dashboardData` state
- ‚úÖ Fetches data from `/api/patient/dashboard`
- ‚úÖ Displays loading spinner while fetching
- ‚úÖ Shows empty states when no data
- ‚úÖ Renders real appointments, prescriptions, records

## üìä Database Tables Used

### Primary Tables:
1. **`patients`** - Patient records
2. **`user_profiles`** - User demographic info
3. **`appointments`** - Scheduled appointments
4. **`prescriptions`** - Medication prescriptions
5. **`medical_records`** - Visit history
6. **`doctors`** - Doctor information
7. **`medications`** - Medication catalog

### Relationships:
```
users (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ (1) user_profiles
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ (1) patients
              ‚îÇ
              ‚îú‚îÄ (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ (many) appointments
              ‚îú‚îÄ (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ (many) prescriptions
              ‚îî‚îÄ (1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ (many) medical_records
```

## üöÄ How to Test

### 1. Login as Patient
```
Email: patient@hospital.com
Password: password123
```

### 2. What You'll See

**If Patient Has Data:**
- Personal profile with MRN, blood type, height, weight
- List of upcoming appointments with doctor details
- Active prescriptions with dosage and status
- Recent medical visit records

**If Patient Has No Data:**
- Empty states with friendly messages
- "Book Appointment" button
- "No active prescriptions" message
- Profile fields won't show if data missing

## üîê Security Features

### Middleware Protection:
- ‚úÖ Route requires authentication (`/patient` is protected)
- ‚úÖ Middleware adds user info to request headers
- ‚úÖ API validates user role is 'patient'
- ‚úÖ Users can only see their own data

### Data Isolation:
```typescript
WHERE p.user_id = $1  // Only current user's data
```

---

## üìù API Query Details

### Get Patient Profile:
```sql
SELECT p.*, up.first_name, up.last_name, up.phone, up.date_of_birth, up.gender
FROM patients p
LEFT JOIN user_profiles up ON p.user_id = up.user_id
WHERE p.user_id = $1
```

### Get Upcoming Appointments:
```sql
SELECT a.*, 
       d.specialization,
       dup.first_name as doctor_first_name,
       dup.last_name as doctor_last_name
FROM appointments a
LEFT JOIN doctors d ON a.doctor_id = d.id
LEFT JOIN user_profiles dup ON d.user_id = dup.user_id
WHERE a.patient_id = $1 
AND a.appointment_date >= NOW()
ORDER BY a.appointment_date ASC
LIMIT 5
```

### Get Active Prescriptions:
```sql
SELECT pr.*, m.name as medication_name
FROM prescriptions pr
LEFT JOIN medications m ON pr.medication_id = m.id
WHERE pr.patient_id = $1 
AND pr.status IN ('pending', 'filled')
ORDER BY pr.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Get Recent Medical Records:
```sql
SELECT mr.*,
       dup.first_name as doctor_first_name,
       dup.last_name as doctor_last_name
FROM medical_records mr
LEFT JOIN doctors d ON mr.doctor_id = d.id
LEFT JOIN user_profiles dup ON d.user_id = dup.user_id
WHERE mr.patient_id = $1
ORDER BY mr.visit_date DESC
LIMIT 5
```

## üé® UI Components

### Dashboard Sections:
1. **Header** - Welcome message with patient name
2. **Quick Stats** - 4 stat cards (appointments, records, prescriptions, health)
3. **Appointments** - Upcoming appointments with doctor info
4. **Prescriptions** - Active medications with status badges
5. **Quick Actions** - Common tasks (book appointment, view records, etc.)
6. **Health Summary** - Blood type, height, weight, allergies

### Empty States:
- Friendly icons and messages
- Call-to-action buttons
- Helpful hints for next steps

## üîÑ Data Flow

```
1. User logs in ‚Üí Cookie set
2. User navigates to /patient
3. Middleware verifies token ‚Üí Adds headers
4. Patient page loads
5. Calls /api/auth/me ‚Üí Gets user info
6. Calls /api/patient/dashboard ‚Üí Gets dashboard data
7. Renders UI with real data
```

---

## ‚ú® Next Steps

To add more data to test:
1. Run `npm run db:seed` to add sample data
2. Or manually insert data via database client
3. Create appointments, prescriptions, medical records

To extend functionality:
1. Add ability to book appointments
2. Request prescription refills
3. View detailed medical records
4. Update profile information
5. View lab test results

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Patient record not found"
- User doesn't have a patient record in database
- Check: `SELECT * FROM patients WHERE user_id = '<user_id>'`
- Solution: Insert patient record

### No data showing
- Patient exists but has no appointments/prescriptions
- This is normal! Empty states will show
- Add data via seed script or manual insertion

### 401 Unauthorized
- User is not authenticated
- Cookie is missing or expired
- Solution: Login again
