### **2. Frontend Components:**

#### **Patient Dashboard (`app/patient/page.tsx`):**
**Added:**
- ‚úÖ Booking modal with form
- ‚úÖ Doctor selection dropdown
- ‚úÖ Date & time pickers
- ‚úÖ Reason textarea
- ‚úÖ Form validation
- ‚úÖ Loading states

**State Management:**
```typescript
const [showBookingModal, setShowBookingModal] = useState(false)
const [doctors, setDoctors] = useState<any[]>([])
const [bookingForm, setBookingForm] = useState({
  doctorId: '',
  appointmentDate: '',
  appointmentTime: '',
  reason: ''
})
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false)
```

**Handler Functions:**

## üìä **Database Schema**

### **`appointments` Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE appointments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  patient_id UUID REFERENCES patients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  doctor_id UUID REFERENCES doctors(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  appointment_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  duration_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 30,
  reason TEXT,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'scheduled' CHECK (status IN ('scheduled', 'confirmed', 'completed', 'cancelled', 'no_show')),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Statuses:**
- `scheduled` - Initial state after booking
- `confirmed` - Doctor confirmed the appointment
- `completed` - Appointment finished
- `cancelled` - Cancelled by patient or doctor
- `no_show` - Patient didn't show up
