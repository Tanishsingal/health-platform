# üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Doctor Dashboard - Real Data Integration

## ‚úÖ Completed!

The doctor dashboard now fetches **real data** from the PostgreSQL database instead of using hardcoded mock data.

---

## üîß What Was Built

### 1. API Endpoint: `/api/doctor/dashboard`
**File:** `app/api/doctor/dashboard/route.ts`

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Authenticates user via middleware headers
- ‚úÖ Fetches doctor profile with user details
- ‚úÖ Gets today's appointments with patient info
- ‚úÖ Retrieves upcoming appointments (next 7 days)
- ‚úÖ Loads recent patients with medical records
- ‚úÖ Calculates statistics (appointments, patients, visits)

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "profile": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "user_id": "uuid",
      "specialization": "Cardiology",
      "department": "Medical",
      "license_number": "MD123456",
      "first_name": "Sarah",
      "last_name": "Smith",
      "phone": "+1234567890"
    },
    "todayAppointments": [...],
    "upcomingAppointments": [...],
    "recentPatients": [...],
    "stats": {
      "todayAppointments": 5,
      "upcomingAppointments": 12,
      "totalPatients": 127,
      "recentVisits": 45
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated Doctor Dashboard
**File:** `app/doctor/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ‚ùå Removed hardcoded `DOCTOR_DATA`
- ‚úÖ Added `dashboardData` state
- ‚úÖ Fetches data from `/api/doctor/dashboard`
- ‚úÖ Displays loading spinner while fetching
- ‚úÖ Shows empty states when no data
- ‚úÖ Renders real appointments, patients, stats
- ‚úÖ Uses tabbed interface for organization

---

## üìä Dashboard Sections

### 1. Quick Stats (4 Cards)
- **Today's Appointments** - Count of appointments scheduled for today
- **Upcoming** - Appointments in the next 7 days
- **Total Patients** - All patients under doctor's care
- **Recent Visits** - Medical records from last 30 days

### 2. Today's Schedule Tab
- List of today's appointments
- Patient name and MRN
- Appointment time and duration
- Status badge (confirmed/scheduled)
- Empty state when no appointments

### 3. Upcoming Appointments Tab

- Patient details
- Date and time

## üîê Security Features

### Middleware Protection:
- ‚úÖ Route requires authentication (`/doctor` is protected)
- ‚úÖ Middleware adds user info to request headers
- ‚úÖ API validates user role is 'doctor'
- ‚úÖ Doctors can only see their own patients

### Data Isolation:
```sql
WHERE d.user_id = $1     -- Only current doctor's data
WHERE a.doctor_id = $1   -- Only this doctor's appointments
WHERE mr.doctor_id = $1  -- Only this doctor's patients
```

---

## üìù API Query Details

### Get Today's Appointments:
```sql
SELECT a.*, 
       p.medical_record_number,
       pup.first_name as patient_first_name,
       pup.last_name as patient_last_name
FROM appointments a
LEFT JOIN patients p ON a.patient_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN user_profiles pup ON p.user_id = pup.user_id
WHERE a.doctor_id = $1 
AND a.appointment_date >= TODAY_START
AND a.appointment_date <= TODAY_END
ORDER BY a.appointment_date ASC
```

### Get Upcoming Appointments:
```sql
SELECT a.*, 
       p.medical_record_number,
       pup.first_name as patient_first_name,
       pup.last_name as patient_last_name
FROM appointments a
LEFT JOIN patients p ON a.patient_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN user_profiles pup ON p.user_id = pup.user_id
WHERE a.doctor_id = $1 
AND a.appointment_date >= TOMORROW
AND a.appointment_date <= NEXT_WEEK
ORDER BY a.appointment_date ASC
LIMIT 5
```

### Get Recent Patients:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ON (p.id)
       p.id,
       p.medical_record_number,
       pup.first_name,
       pup.last_name,
       pup.gender,
       mr.visit_date,
       mr.diagnosis
FROM medical_records mr
LEFT JOIN patients p ON mr.patient_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN user_profiles pup ON p.user_id = pup.user_id
WHERE mr.doctor_id = $1
ORDER BY p.id, mr.visit_date DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Get Statistics:
```sql
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM appointments WHERE doctor_id = $1 AND appointment_date = TODAY) as today_appointments,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM appointments WHERE doctor_id = $1 AND appointment_date > TODAY) as upcoming_appointments,
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT patient_id) FROM medical_records WHERE doctor_id = $1) as total_patients,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM medical_records WHERE doctor_id = $1 AND visit_date >= CURRENT_DATE - 30 days) as recent_visits
```

## üöÄ How to Test

### 1. Login as Doctor
```
Email: doctor@hospital.com
Password: password123
```

### 2. What You'll See

**If Doctor Has Data:**
- Doctor profile with specialization
- Today's appointment count and list
- Upcoming appointments for next 7 days
- Recent patients with visit history
- Statistics cards with real numbers

**If Doctor Has No Data:**
- Empty states with friendly messages
- "No appointments today" message
- Tabs still work but show empty states
- Stats show zeros

## üé® UI Features

### Tabbed Interface:
- **Today's Schedule** - Focus on immediate tasks
- **Upcoming** - Plan ahead for next week
- **Recent Patients** - Quick access to patient history

### Color Coding:
- Today's appointments - Primary blue
- Upcoming appointments - Light blue
- Recent patients - Green
- Status badges - Default/Secondary

### Empty States:
- Large icons
- Helpful messages
- Clean design

## üîÑ Data Flow

```
1. User logs in as doctor ‚Üí Cookie set
2. User navigates to /doctor
3. Middleware verifies token ‚Üí Adds headers
4. Doctor page loads
5. Calls /api/auth/me ‚Üí Gets user info
6. Calls /api/doctor/dashboard ‚Üí Gets dashboard data
7. Renders UI with real data in tabs
```

---

## ‚ú® Next Steps

To add more data to test:
1. Run `npm run db:seed` if not already done
2. Manually insert appointments, medical records
3. Create patient records associated with doctor

To extend functionality:
1. Add ability to create new appointments
2. View detailed patient records
3. Write prescriptions
4. Add medical notes
5. View patient history timeline

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Doctor record not found"
- User doesn't have a doctor record in database
- Check: `SELECT * FROM doctors WHERE user_id = '<user_id>'`
- Solution: Insert doctor record

### No data showing
- Doctor exists but has no appointments/patients
- This is normal! Empty states will show
- Add data via seed script or manual insertion

### 401 Unauthorized
- User is not authenticated
- Cookie is missing or expired
- Solution: Login again

### Nurses seeing empty data
- Nurses can access `/doctor` route but API only works for doctors
- Nurses will see empty states
- This is intentional - nurses need separate API
