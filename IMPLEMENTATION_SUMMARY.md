## üöÄ How to Complete the Setup

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

You need to create the `patient_documents` table in your database. You have two options:

**Option A: Using the migration script**
```bash
# Make sure your .env file has DATABASE_URL set
node scripts/run-medical-history-migration.js
```

**Option B: Run SQL directly**
```bash
# Connect to your database and run:
psql -d your_database -f scripts/add_medical_history_table.sql
```

**Option C: Copy-paste SQL**
Open your database client and execute the SQL from `scripts/add_medical_history_table.sql`

### Step 2: Verify the Installation

Check that the table was created:
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name = 'patient_documents';
```

### Step 3: Test the Features

1. **As a Patient:**
   - Log in to the patient portal
   - Click "Update Profile" in the Health Summary card

2. **As a Doctor:**
   - Navigate to a patient's detail page
